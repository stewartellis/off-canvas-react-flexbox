# Off Canvas Layout with React & Flexbox

## The Deal

Some great off canvas layouts have been done by other folks out there, particularly ([tympanus.net](http://tympanus.net/Development/OffCanvasMenuEffects/)). This take on it tries to deliver on a few things

- built with flexbox & react
- built without jQuery
- should not rely on css selectors that target adjacent elements - the burger should be able to go anywhere
- should default to visible on desktop and hidden on mobile
- menu links only hide the sidebar on mobile, otherwise sidebar stay visible on desktop
